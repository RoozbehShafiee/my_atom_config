Atom Package to decrypt and encrypt ansible-vault file.

Press <kbd>ctrl-alt-0</kbd> to encrypt and decrypt file.

**NOTE**: On the first installation, package searches ansible-vault binary in **/usr/local/bin/ansible-vault**.
If it isn't in that directory, it's necessary to set absolute path in settings tab.

## Dependencies

  ```
  This option enables automatic de/encryt on opening of vault files

  ```
  This option enables the package to use a specific vault password file
  for any de/encrytion actions.
